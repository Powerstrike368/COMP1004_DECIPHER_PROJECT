COMP 1004 ALL YEAR COMPUTING PRACTICE MODULE FINAL PORTFOLIO FOR STUDENT 10919643 THOMAS BANCROFT

Decipher! is my project for the computing practice module. The aim with this project was to provide an introduction and simple tool for encryption and decryption with some simple Symmetric key methods.
A secondary goal was to introduce myself to the programming behind Encryption and Ciphers as it is a personal area of interest.

Decipher functions by taking an input, applying a method (chosen by the user) and outputting appropriate ciphertext in accordance to that plaintext with the method, all through the use of javascript 
This process works both ways! also working for decryption as well (although for methods ONE TIME PAD and XOR, some data integrity can be lost and decryption is not always accurate due to concessions made surrounding format

Users can also save their Ciphers to a JSON file and share it with friends, who can upload the JSON file and find out what the message says, which is where the output and input of JSON from a flat file is used!

Decipher, in comparison to other similar tools, aims to give quick and eays explanations of how each of the 5 ciphers work, and how you can understand the way they keep data and messages private, as well as for a few give examples of historical usage

I hope you enjoy the tool
